# naive-anti-resize-steganography
a na√Øve steganography method to resist corruption of data cuased by the resizing of the image file. Made to bypass [ICDR's resize function](https://github.com/ArielCyber/ICDR).

To run install PIL and numpy and run the enc.py to generate the image. The hidden message can be found under the variable msg.
To decrypt the image run the dec.py from the same folder as the generated image.

The generated image can be seen as image.png
